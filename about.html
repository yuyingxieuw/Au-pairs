            <b>Project Idea</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>The Au Pair Program is a cultural exchange initiative that allows young people (18-26 years old), with at least a middle school degree, to live with a host family in another country. Under this program, they can continue their education while providing childcare and experiencing the host country's culture.

            In the US, the Au Pair Program operates under the J-1 Exchange Visitor Visa Program with a maximum stay time of 24 months. This website is designed to show the basic statistics of the Au Pair Program in the United States, offering a dashboard tracking the participants and sponsors of Au Pairs from 2016 to 2022 in each state. Through the dashboard, readers can easily get information on the change in participation numbers, visa sponsors, and spatial differences across the US.

            <b>Project Significance/Broader Impacts</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>The dashboard monitors cultural exchange participation trends and regional engagement, providing insights into the program's impact on cross-cultural understanding and international relationships. By visualizing data on visa sponsors and participation rates, it promotes program transparency, ensuring accountability among organizations and highlighting their contributions. Simplifying complex data into an interactive format enhances accessibility, allowing stakeholders to quickly grasp trends without requiring specialized analytical skills. Additionally, the dashboard aids policy and program improvement by identifying spatial disparities, such as underserved states, and temporal trends, like declining participation, helping policymakers and sponsors address gaps and enhance outreach efforts.

            <b>Intended Audience</b> 
        </h3>
        <p>Our intended audience includes: Researchers focused on the care economy and domestic workers, including prospective and current au pairs, host families, program sponsors, and policymakers, can leverage this data for various purposes. Young individuals exploring au pair opportunities can assess popular states, sponsor organizations, and program trends, while host families can evaluate regional norms, program growth, and sponsor reliability. Program sponsors managing J-1 visas can benchmark performance, identify underserved regions, and strategize outreach efforts. Meanwhile, policymakers and government agencies overseeing the J-1 visa program can use the data to monitor compliance, evaluate program effectiveness, and allocate resources more efficiently..</p>
