# Au-pairs Participant Dashborad

The Au Pair Program is a cultural exchange initiative that allows young people (18-26 years old), with at least a middle school degree, to live with a host family in another country. Under this program, they can continue their education while providing childcare and experiencing the host country's culture.

In the US, the Au Pair Program operates under the J-1 Exchange Visitor Visa Program with a maximum stay time of 24 months. This website is designed to show the basic statistics of the Au Pair Program in the United States, offering a dashboard tracking the participants and sponsors of Au Pairs from 2016 to 2022 in each state. Through the dashboard, readers can easily get information on the change in participation numbers, visa sponsors, and spatial differences across the US. Data is collected from [Bridge USA]().
